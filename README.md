This is a sample project to use grpc with golang/java and bazel.
And this project is developed with vscode.

There are several things I learned in development phase:
1. Use maven to manage java project is still a good idea even when I'm using bazel.
2. rules_proto_grpc is better than the native proto support of bazel.
